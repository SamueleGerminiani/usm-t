You are an expert in formal verification and temporal logic synthesis.
Your task is to analyze a Verilog hardware design together with simulation traces provided in CSV format, and automatically generate candidate LTL specifications that describe the system’s intended behavior.

Input:
- A Verilog module implementing a digital design.
- (Optional) A CSV file containing time-ordered simulation traces of the design’s signals (each column is a signal name, each row is a clock tick).

Goal:
Infer likely correctness properties of the design expressed in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
Where: G means “globally” (always).
The antecedent and consequent are propositional or temporal expressions over the design’s signals.
You may use temporal operators such as X (next), F (eventually), G (globally), and U (until), and SERE operators such ##1 as ; (followed by).
You may use Boolean connectives (!, &&, ||) and signal names directly from the Verilog/CSV.
Syntactic correctness is fundamental:
Every generated formula must be well-formed according to standard LTL syntax.
Parentheses must be correctly balanced.
Logical and temporal operators must be used in their proper positions.
Each signal name must correspond exactly to an identifier from the Verilog design or the CSV header.
No free or undefined variables are allowed.

Guidelines:
Derive candidate properties that are consistent with the simulation traces (never violated in the data).
Avoid trivial tautologies or contradictions.
Express each property in a clean LTL formula, one per line.

Required output format example:
--[Start]--
G( req -> F ack )
G( reset -> X !out )
--[End]--

The temporal depth of the specifications is between 0 and 0


Note that the base patter is always G(... -> ...).
Use the inputs of the module for the left side of the implication and the outputs for the right side.
The inputs are a_4,b_3,a_8,a_0,b_5,b_7,b_6,a_3,a_7,a_6,b_9,b_8,a_5,b_0,a_9,b_1,a_2,a_1,b_2,b_4 and the outputs are c_1,d_3,c_4,d_6,c_3,c_0,c_2,d_7,d_8,d_1,d_9,d_4,c_8,d_0,c_6,d_5,c_7,c_5,c_9,d_2.



The <-> operator is not allowed.

✓ - syntetic -> synthetic  
✓ - Remove verilator_tests
✓ - change the name of gen.py to something more meaningful 
✓ - setup_env must unified with the one in the root 
✓ - the temp directory must appear and disappear automatically, only in debug mode it should be kept
✓ - output directory is specified in the config, otherwise is default to "./synthetic_gen_output" <-| Where is the output? add --output option (or similar to specify the output directory)
✓ - Remove useless script and examples inside hif_sim
✓ - Added some debug features, can be refined if needed <-| Add debug features: if something goes wrong I need to quickly understand what happened.
✓ - New feature: use the vcd2csv tool (inside usm-t) convert the generated vcd to csv (we always need both versions to run the miners)
- Remove the configuration file, there are too few parameters to justify it, use command line arguments instead. Also use command line arguments to specify the templates (is this a good idea?)
- Add tests for most combinations of input parameters, including the different templates
- New feature: decide how many specifications in the same module (max 5 per module: ltl2synth explodes)
- New feature: need to automatically instrument usm-t with the generated synthetic test. Furthermore, we need to generate several synthetic tests, especially if HIF performance issues are not solvable. Use the "usm-t/miners/usmt_default_config.xml" to generate the synthetic test xml file.
- Performance fix: why is HIF so slow? Is because it is compiled in debug mode? Recompile HIF in release mode.

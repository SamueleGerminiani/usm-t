- syntetic -> synthetic  ✓
- Remove verilator_tests  ✓
- change the name of gen.py to something more meaningful
- setup_env must unified with the one in the root  ✓
- the temp directory must appear and disappear automatically, only in debug mode it should be kept
- Where is the output? add --output option (or similar to specify the output directory)
- Remove the configuration file, there are too few parameters to justify it, use command line arguments instead. Also use command line arguments to specify the templates (is this a good idea?)
- Add tests for most combinations of input parameters, including the different templates
- Add debug features: if something goes wrong I need to quickly understand what happened.
- New feature: decide how many specifications in the same module (max 5 per module: ltl2synth explodes)
- New feature: use the vcd2csv tool (inside usm-t) convert the generated vcd to csv (we always need both versions to run the miners)
- New feature: need to automatically instrument usm-t with the generated synthetic test. Furthermore, we need to generate several synthetic tests, especially if HIF performance issues are not solvable. Use the "usm-t/miners/usmt_default_config.xml" to generate the synthetic test xml file.
- Performance fix: why is HIF so slow? Is because it is compiled in debug mode? Recompile HIF in release mode.
